2. Gap Analysis
=============

Category: Users Management

Missing: Specific requirements for video consultations (e.g., video quality, recording capabilities, screen sharing, waiting room functionality, integration with medical devices).
Importance: Ensures high-quality online consultations and supports various telemedicine needs.
Standard: WebRTC for real-time communication. HIPAA compliant video conferencing platforms are crucial.
Risk: Poor user experience during online consultations, inability to perform certain diagnostic procedures remotely, potential HIPAA violations.
Priority: High

Category: Prescription Management
Missing: Electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) capabilities, including drug interaction checks, formulary management, and integration with pharmacies.
Importance: Reduces medication errors, improves patient safety, and streamlines the prescription process.
Standard: E-prescribing standards (e.g., NCPDP SCRIPT).
Risk: Medication errors, increased administrative burden, delays in filling prescriptions.
Priority: High

Category: Medical Records
Missing: Details on how patient records are managed (e.g., data storage, retrieval, access control, data formats).  Interoperability standards for exchanging medical data (e.g., FHIR).
Importance: Ensures secure storage and retrieval of sensitive patient data and facilitates interoperability with other healthcare systems.
Standard: HIPAA, GDPR for data privacy and security. HL7 FHIR is the industry standard for healthcare interoperability.
Risk: Data loss, unauthorized access, difficulty in sharing patient data with other healthcare providers.
Priority: High

Category: Payment Processing
Missing: Online payment integration for consultations and other services.
Importance: Streamlines the payment process for both patients and the hospital.
Standard: PCI DSS for secure payment processing.
Risk: Delayed payments, increased administrative burden, potential security risks.
Priority: High

Category: Notifications
Missing: Automated notifications for appointments, medication reminders, and other important events.

Risk: Missed appointments, reduced patient adherence to treatment plans.
Priority: Medium

Category: Security & Privacy
Missing: Specific security and privacy measures, including data encryption, access control, audit trails, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
Importance: Protects sensitive patient data and ensures compliance with legal requirements.
Standard: HIPAA, GDPR, NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Risk: Data breaches, legal penalties, loss of patient trust.
Priority: High

Category: Reporting & Analytics

Decision: Integrate with an e-prescribing platform and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

Category: Medical Records
Question: Regarding details on how patient records are managed (e.g., data storage, retrieval, access control, data formats).  interoperability standards for exchanging medical data (e.g., fhir)., which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Implement secure data storage and retrieval mechanisms, define access control policies, and adopt FHIR for interoperability.

Category: Payment Processing
Question: Regarding online payment integration for consultations and other services., which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Integrate with a secure payment gateway and ensure compliance with PCI DSS.

Category: Notifications
Question: Regarding automated notifications for appointments, medication reminders, and other important events., which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Implement an automated notification system for appointment reminders, medication refills, and other relevant events.

Category: Security & Privacy
Question: Regarding specific security and privacy measures, including data encryption, access control, audit trails, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., hipaa, gdpr)., which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Implement robust security measures, including data encryption, access control, audit trails, and regular security assessments.

Category: Reporting & Analytics
Question: Regarding reporting and analytics capabilities to track key metrics, such as patient demographics, appointment volumes, and revenue., which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Implement reporting and analytics features to track relevant metrics and generate customized reports.
