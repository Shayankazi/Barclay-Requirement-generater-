2. Gap Analysis
=============

Category: Users Management
Missing: User authentication and authorization
Importance: Essential for controlling access to the retail system and protecting user data.  Different users may have different levels of access (e.g., guest, registered user, administrator).
Standard: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC) are widely adopted standards for authentication and authorization.
Risk: Unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential legal liabilities.
Priority: High

Category: Administrative Features
Missing: Administrative dashboard and tools
Importance: Allows administrators to manage products, users, monitor system performance, and configure system settings.
Standard: No specific standard, but common practice in retail systems management.
Risk: Inefficient system management, difficulty in responding to issues, and lack of control over the system.
Priority: High

Category: Reporting & Analytics
Missing: Reporting and analytics capabilities
Importance: Essential for understanding user behavior, product performance, sales trends, and other key metrics to make informed business decisions.
Standard: No single standard, but common tools and techniques include data warehousing, business intelligence platforms, and reporting tools.
Risk: Inability to track key metrics, difficulty in identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.
Priority: Medium

Category: Payment Processing
Missing: Payment gateway integration (if applicable)
Importance: Necessary if the retail system involves online transactions. Enables secure processing of payments.
Standard: PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) for secure payment processing.
Risk: Inability to process online payments, loss of revenue, and security vulnerabilities.
Priority: Medium

Category: User Experience
Missing: Specific UX/UI requirements
Importance: A well-defined UX/UI is crucial for user satisfaction and adoption of the retail system.  This should include considerations for accessibility.
Standard: WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for accessibility.
Risk: Poor user experience, low user adoption, and negative impact on brand reputation.
Priority: High

Category: Notifications
Missing: Notification system for users and administrators
Importance: Keeps users informed about order updates, promotions, etc.  Allows administrators to be alerted about system issues.
Standard: No specific standard but best practices include email, SMS, and in-app notifications.
Risk: Missed updates for users, delayed responses to system issues, and reduced user engagement.
Priority: Medium


3. Gap Resolution
===============

Category: Users Management
Question: Regarding user authentication and authorization, which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Implement user registration, login, and access control mechanisms using a robust authentication framework like OAuth 2.0 or OIDC.

Category: Administrative Features
Question: Regarding administrative dashboard and tools, which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Alternative approach to Administrative dashboard and tools

Category: Reporting & Analytics
Question: Regarding reporting and analytics capabilities, which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Integrate a reporting and analytics module that allows for data collection, analysis, and visualization.  Consider using a pre-built analytics platform or building a custom solution.

Category: Payment Processing
Question: Regarding payment gateway integration (if applicable), which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Custom implementation

Category: User Experience
Question: Regarding specific ux/ui requirements, which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Conduct user research and design a user-friendly and intuitive interface.  Adhere to accessibility guidelines.

Category: Notifications
Question: Regarding notification system for users and administrators, which approach would you prefer?
Decision: Alternative approach to Notification system for users and administrators


4. Requirement Clarifications
==========================

Question: What type of search functionality should be implemented?
Decision: Keyword-based search with auto-suggestions and spell check

Question: How should product filtering be implemented?
Decision: Client-side filtering using JavaScript frameworks

Question: What is the acceptable average response time for search queries?
Decision: Under 200 milliseconds

Question: What database technology should be used to handle product data?
Decision: NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for flexible schema and horizontal scaling

Question: What level of data encryption should be implemented for sensitive customer data?
Decision: Encryption at rest and in transit using AES-256

Question: What specific industry regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR) apply to the system?
Decision: PCI DSS and HIPAA

Question: What systems need to be integrated with the retail system?
Decision: Inventory management, payment gateway, and CRM
