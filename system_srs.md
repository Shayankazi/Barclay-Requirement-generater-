## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the requirements for a comprehensive Hospital Management System (HMS). The primary goal of the HMS is to streamline hospital operations, improve patient care, and enhance administrative efficiency. The business value lies in reduced operational costs, improved patient satisfaction, and better data-driven decision-making.

## 2. Scope

*   **Included Features:** Appointment management, schedule management, patient records management, online consultations, insurance integration, user management, e-prescribing, payment processing, automated notifications, reporting and analytics.
*   **System Boundaries:** The system encompasses all aspects of patient care, administrative tasks, and financial operations within the hospital. It interacts with external insurance providers and e-prescribing platforms.
*   **Excluded Features:** Inventory management of medical supplies, advanced medical imaging analysis, and integration with external research databases are explicitly excluded from the initial scope.

## 3. Stakeholders

*   **Patients:** Book appointments, access medical records, participate in online consultations. (Responsibility: Provide accurate information).
*   **Doctors:** Manage schedules, conduct consultations, prescribe medications, access patient records. (Responsibility: Provide quality care and maintain accurate records).
*   **Administrators:** Oversee hospital operations, manage user accounts, generate reports, configure system settings. (Responsibility: Ensure efficient and secure system operation).
*   **Insurance Providers:** Verify insurance information, process claims. (Responsibility: Provide timely and accurate claim processing).

## 4. Features

*   **Appointment Management:** Allows patients to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
*   **Schedule Management:** Enables doctors to manage their availability and appointment schedules.

*   **Online Consultations:** Facilitates virtual consultations between patients and doctors.
*   **Insurance Integration:** Integrates with insurance providers for eligibility verification and claims processing.
*   **User Management:** Provides secure user registration, login, and role-based access control.
*   **E-Prescribing:** Enables doctors to electronically prescribe medications.
*   **Payment Processing:** Securely processes patient payments for services rendered.
*   **Automated Notifications:** Sends automated reminders and notifications to patients and doctors.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:** Generates reports and provides analytics on key hospital metrics.
